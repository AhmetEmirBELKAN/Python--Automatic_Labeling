# Python--Automatic_Labeling
Auto-Labeling with pre-trained yolo model
Labeling new frames with the pre-trained yolo model. If you press the "s" key, it labels the detected object and creates a .xml file. When the "a" key is pressed, the pictures that the model cannot predict but that we can manually mark later, are transferred to the failImgDetect file. When the "d" key is pressed, they are thrown into the noisy pictures folder.
